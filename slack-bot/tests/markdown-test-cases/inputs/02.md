Great! I've successfully cloned the bolt-python repository and explored several key files. Here's what I found:

## Repository Overview: Slack Bolt for Python 🔩

**Bolt for Python** is a framework for building Slack apps quickly using the latest Slack platform features.

### Files Explored:

1. **README.md** - Main documentation showing:
   - Framework supports Python 3.7+
   - Provides both synchronous (`App`) and asynchronous (`AsyncApp`) implementations
   - Supports multiple deployment modes (HTTP webhooks, Socket Mode)
   - Offers decorators for listening to various Slack events (messages, actions, commands, shortcuts, etc.)
   - Includes helper functions like `ack`, `say`, `respond`, and `client` for common operations

2. **pyproject.toml** - Build configuration:
   - Uses setuptools as build backend
   - Supports Python 3.7 through 3.14
   - Main dependency: `slack_sdk>=3.38.0,<4`
   - Configured with Black formatter, pytest, and mypy for type checking
   - MIT licensed

3. **slack_bolt/__init__.py** - Main package exports:
   - Exports core classes: `App`, `BoltContext`, `Ack`, `Respond`, `Say`, etc.
   - Includes **AI Agents & Assistants** features (Assistant, AssistantThreadContext, thread context stores)
   - Provides context utilities: `SetStatus`, `SetTitle`, `SetSuggestedPrompts`, `SaveThreadContext`

4. **slack_bolt/async_app.py** - Async module entry point:
   - Exports async versions of all core classes (`AsyncApp`, `AsyncAck`, `AsyncBoltContext`, etc.)
   - Requires aiohttp for async web framework support
   - Supports integration with Sanic, FastAPI, Starlette through adapters

The framework is well-structured with clear separation between sync/async implementations and includes modern features like AI assistant support! 🚀
