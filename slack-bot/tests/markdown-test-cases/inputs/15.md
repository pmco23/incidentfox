Perfect! I've successfully cloned the bolt-python repository and read its README.md file. Here's a summary of what I found:

## Bolt for Python - Overview

**Bolt for Python** is a framework by Slack for building Slack apps quickly using the latest platform features.

### Key Features:

1. **Setup Requirements**: Python 3.7+ required
2. **Installation**: `pip install slack_bolt`

### Main Capabilities:

- **Synchronous & Async Support**: Supports both standard Python apps and async apps using `asyncio` and AIOHTTP
- **Socket Mode**: Can run apps using Socket Mode (no need for ngrok or public endpoints)
- **Event Listeners**: Multiple listener types for different Slack events:
  - Actions (buttons, select menus, etc.)
  - Commands (slash commands)
  - Events (Events API)
  - Functions (workflow custom steps)
  - Messages
  - Options (external select menus)
  - Shortcuts
  - Views (modals)

### Quick Start Example:
```python
from slack_bolt import App

app = App()  # Uses SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET and SLACK_BOT_TOKEN env vars

# Add listeners here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.start(3000)
```

### Key Arguments in Listeners:
- `body`, `payload` - Event data
- `ack` - Must be called to acknowledge events
- `say` - Send messages to channels
- `respond` - Respond to events with response_url
- `client` - Web API client
- `logger` - Logging instance
- `complete`/`fail` - For custom workflow steps

The framework supports various adapters for web frameworks like Sanic, FastAPI, and Starlette, with examples available in the repository.
