Perfect! I've successfully cloned the bolt-python repository and read its README. Here's a summary of what **Bolt for Python** is:

## Overview
**Bolt for Python** is a Python framework developed by Slack for building Slack apps quickly using the latest platform features. It requires Python 3.7+ and is available via PyPI as `slack-bolt`.

## Key Features

### Installation
```bash
pip install slack_bolt
```

### Two App Types:
1. **Synchronous App** - Standard `App` class
2. **Asynchronous App** - `AsyncApp` class using asyncio and AIOHTTP

### Running Modes:
- **HTTP Mode**: Traditional webhook-based approach (requires ngrok for local development)
- **Socket Mode**: WebSocket-based connection (no ngrok needed)

### Core Functionality

The framework provides listeners for various Slack events:
- **Actions** - Block Kit interactive elements (buttons, menus, etc.)
- **Commands** - Slash commands
- **Events** - Events API events
- **Functions** - Custom workflow steps
- **Messages** - Message events with pattern matching
- **Options** - External data source requests
- **Shortcuts** - Global or message shortcuts
- **Views** - Modal submissions

### Listener Arguments
Functions receive helpful arguments like:
- `body` / `payload` - Event data
- `ack` - Acknowledge receipt (required for many events)
- `say` - Send messages to channels
- `respond` - Respond to events with response_url
- `client` - Web API client
- `logger` - Built-in logging
- `complete` / `fail` - For workflow step handling

### Framework Compatibility
Bolt includes adapters for various async web frameworks like Sanic, FastAPI, and Starlette.

The repository also contains extensive examples and documentation at https://docs.slack.dev/tools/bolt-python/
