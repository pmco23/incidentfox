Perfect! I've successfully cloned the bolt-python repository and read its README.md. Here's a summary of what this project is about:

## Bolt for Python

**Bolt for Python** is a framework developed by Slack for building Slack apps quickly using Python. Here are the key highlights:

### Main Features:
- **Quick Setup**: Requires Python 3.7+, installed via `pip install slack_bolt`
- **Simple App Creation**: Build both synchronous and asynchronous apps
- **Socket Mode Support**: Can run apps without exposing public endpoints (no ngrok needed)
- **Event Listeners**: Easy methods to listen for various Slack events like:
  - Block Kit actions (buttons, menus, etc.)
  - Slash commands
  - Events API events
  - Shortcuts
  - Modal submissions
  - Workflow functions

### Two App Types:
1. **Synchronous Apps** (`App`): Standard Python apps
2. **Asynchronous Apps** (`AsyncApp`): Using asyncio/await pattern with AIOHTTP

### Key Arguments Available in Listeners:
- `body` - Full request body
- `payload` - Event-specific data
- `ack` - Acknowledge receipt (required for most events)
- `say` - Send messages to channels
- `respond` - Respond to events with response_url
- `client` - Web API client
- `logger` - Built-in logging
- `complete`/`fail` - For custom workflow steps

### Running Options:
- **HTTP Mode**: Requires exposing an endpoint (uses ngrok for local dev)
- **Socket Mode**: Uses WebSocket connection (no public endpoint needed)

The repository includes extensive examples and supports integration with various async web frameworks like Sanic, FastAPI, and Starlette.
