Perfect! I've successfully cloned the bolt-python repository and read its README.md file. Here's a summary of what the repository contains:

## Bolt for Python - Overview

**Bolt for Python** is a Python framework for building Slack apps quickly using the latest platform features. It's designed to make Slack app development simple and efficient.

### Key Features:
