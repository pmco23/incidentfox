# IncidentFox Codebase Quality Audit — Master Plan

**Created**: 2026-02-16
**Owner**: CTO-level review, executed by AI agents in parallel workspaces
**Goal**: Thorough quality control of an AI-generated codebase before it ships to paying customers

---

## Context

This is a YC-backed startup's open-source product. Most code was written by AI agents with limited human review. The product is deployed to real customer environments on AWS EKS. We support Slack, web UI, and are adding MS Teams + Google Chat. We need to treat this as a production-grade audit — finding bugs, security holes, logic errors, dead code, and architectural inconsistencies before they become customer incidents.

**Codebase scope**: ~50-70K LOC across 6 active services, 6 deprecated services, Helm charts, Terraform, CI/CD workflows. ~1800 markdown files.

---

## Phase -1: Harvest & Port from Deprecated Services (Do Before Cleanup)

**Why first**: `agent/` has ~20K lines of production-tested tools and `unified-agent/` has a config-driven agent builder. Much of this is valuable and not yet in sre-agent. We need to extract what's useful BEFORE deleting these directories.

### Gap Analysis Summary

**What sre-agent already has** (24 skills, 116 scripts):
- K8s, GitHub, Slack, PagerDuty, Grafana, Coralogix, Datadog, Elasticsearch, Jaeger, Loki, Splunk, VictoriaMetrics, VictoriaLogs, Honeycomb, Confluence, ClickUp, RAPTOR knowledge base

**What agent/ has that sre-agent does NOT** (high-value unique tools):

| Tool | Lines | What it does | Priority |
|------|-------|-------------|----------|
| Azure tools | 1,532 | 20+ tools: VMs, AKS, Log Analytics (KQL), Cost Mgmt, App Insights, SQL, Cosmos | HIGH |
| PostgreSQL tools | 1,022 | 9 tools: replication monitoring, blocking queries, lock analysis | HIGH |

**Architectural patterns to port** (from agent/ and unified-agent/):

| Pattern | Source | Lines | What it does | Priority |
|---------|--------|-------|-------------|----------|
| Config-driven agent builder | both | ~900 | Build agent hierarchies from JSON config, topological sort | CRITICAL |
| Output handlers (Teams, Google Chat) | agent/ | ~734 | Multi-surface agent output (Adaptive Cards, Card v2) | HIGH |
| MCP client integration | agent/ | 413 | Per-team MCP server discovery and lifecycle | HIGH |
| Human interaction protocol | agent/ | 316 | ask_human() with abstract channel interface | HIGH |
| A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol | agent/ | 239 | Remote agent delegation via JSON-RPC 2.0 | MEDIUM |

| Event stream registry | agent/ | ~200 | Nested agent visibility in streaming | LOW |

### -1A. Port HIGH priority tools as sre-agent skills ✅ COMPLETE

All 21 high-priority tools have been ported across 5 batches (172 files, ~11,780 lines). Merged in PR #413.

**Batch 1** (infrastructure): ✅ Azure, GCP, Docker
**Batch 2** (databases): ✅ PostgreSQL, MySQL, Snowflake, BigQuery
**Batch 3** (observability): ✅ Sentry, New Relic
**Batch 4** (collaboration): ✅ Jira, GitLab, Kafka
**Batch 5** (remaining): ✅ Incident.io, Opsgenie, Blameless, FireHydrant, Notion, Linear, Google Docs, Sourcegraph

**Not ported** (low priority):
- [ ] Port DB migration tools (Flyway, Alembic, Prisma)
- [ ] Port Schema Registry, Debezium tools

### -1B. Port architectural patterns

These require more careful integration into sre-agent's existing architecture:

- [ ] **Config-driven agent builder**: Port `agent_builder.py` pattern to sre-agent. This enables per-team agent customization via config-service JSON. Key features: topological sort, agent-as-tool, model alias resolution, tool enable/disable.
- [ ] **Output handlers for Teams & Google Chat**: Port the Adaptive Cards (Teams) and Card v2 (Google Chat) output handlers. These are needed for the orchestrator's multi-surface support.
- [ ] **MCP client integration**: Port the per-team MCP server discovery pattern so teams can bring their own MCP tools.
- [ ] **Human interaction protocol**: Port ask_human() with its abstract channel interface for human-in-the-loop workflows.
- [ ] **Proxy mode in all tools**: Ensure every new skill supports both direct API mode and credential-proxy mode.

### -1C. Validate ported tools work

- [ ] For each ported skill, verify it loads correctly in sre-agent
- [ ] Test at least one script from each skill against a mock or real endpoint
- [ ] Verify credential-proxy mode works for skills that need it
- [ ] Run the ported skills through the existing sre-agent test harness

### Execution strategy for Phase -1

This phase is highly parallelizable. Each tool port is independent:
- **12+ workspaces in parallel**: One per tool/skill batch
- **Estimated effort**: 1 session per simple tool (API wrapper), 2-3 sessions for complex tools (Azure, PostgreSQL, Kafka)
- **Architecture ports**: 1 dedicated workspace each, sequential within workspace

---

## Phase 0: Dead Code Removal (After Porting)

**Why first**: ~35MB of deprecated code makes every other review harder. Clean the house before inspecting it.

### 0A. Catalog what's actually deprecated ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] `unified-agent/` — DELETED. No external dependencies. All tools ported to sre-agent skills.
- [x] `agent/` — Cannot delete yet. `generate_golden_prompts.py` imports `ai_agent.prompts.*`. Docker Hub workflow builds it.
- [x] `knowledge_base/` — Cannot delete yet. `ultimate_rag/` has 21 imports from `knowledge_base.raptor` + Dockerfile COPY.
- [x] `ai_pipeline/` — NOT deprecated. Premium feature under active development, just not deployed.
- [x] `dependency_service/` — Stub only (README.md). Placeholder for premium feature.
- [x] `correlation_service/` — Stub only (README.md). Placeholder for premium feature.

### 0B. Extract value before deletion ✅ COMPLETE

- [ ] Port `agent_builder.py` pattern for config-driven subagents (deferred — not blocking deletion)
- [ ] Port Teams & Google Chat output handlers (deferred — not blocking deletion)

### 0C. Remove dead code ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Deleted `unified-agent/` directory (PR #415)
- [x] Removed `local/docker-compose.yml` (deprecated trial stack) (PR #415)

---

## Phase 4: Core Logic Review — slack-bot ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: Audited — 12 findings (3 P0, 4 P1, 3 P2, 2 P3), all deferred. Findings require architectural changes (Redis state store, SSE backpressure) beyond audit scope.

See `.context/findings/phase-4-slack-bot-findings.md` for details.

---

---

## Phase 7: Core Logic Review — ultimate_rag

**Why**: Knowledge base for the agent. Zero tests currently.

### 7A. API server
- [ ] Review `api/server.py` (54 classes!) — that's a massive file
- [ ] Check auth and multi-tenancy in RAG queries
- [ ] Review document ingestion pipeline
- [ ] Check for data isolation between teams

### 7B. Retrieval & reranking
- [ ] Review retrieval strategies (9 strategy classes)
- [ ] Check reranker implementation (7 classes)
- [ ] Verify embedding model configuration
- [ ] Review RAPTOR tree building logic

---

## Phase 8: Infrastructure & Deployment Review

### 8A. Helm chart

- [ ] Check values.yaml defaults for security
- [ ] Compare staging vs production values — are there gaps?
- [ ] Validate pilot/customer template completeness
- [ ] Run `helm template` to check for rendering errors
- [ ] Check resource requests/limits for all pods

### 8B. CI/CD workflows
- [ ] Review all 12 GitHub Actions workflows
- [ ] Check for missing CI steps (no type checking, no integration tests in CI?)
- [ ] Review deploy-eks.yml — proper staging→prod promotion?
- [ ] Check secret handling in CI
- [ ] Review Trivy and gitleaks configs — what are they ignoring?

### 8C. Docker Compose (local dev)

### 8D. Terraform
- [ ] Review `infra/terraform/` for each environment
- [ ] Check IAM policies — least privilege?
- [ ] Review VPC, security groups, NACLs
- [ ] Check EKS cluster config

---

## Phase 9: Documentation & Developer Experience

**Cross-cutting requirement**: As code is reviewed or changed in **any** phase, update or create documentation to be clean, correct, and up-to-date. Docs serve three audiences:

1. **Internal developers** — Architecture context, service-level READMEs, development guides, code comments where logic isn't self-evident
2. **Coding agents** — CLAUDE.md, SCRATCHPAD.md, .context/ files, skill SKILL.md files, inline docstrings on public APIs
3. **End users / customers** — API references, configuration guides, onboarding docs, deployment guides

This is not a phase-9-only concern — every phase should leave docs better than it found them.

### 9A. Accuracy audit
- [ ] Compare CLAUDE.md architecture description with actual code — are they in sync?
- [ ] Review README.md — does getting started actually work?
- [ ] Check docs/ accuracy against current implementation
- [ ] Review CONTRIBUTING.md — does the development workflow work?
- [ ] Check all service READMEs for accuracy

### 9B. Missing documentation
- [ ] API documentation (OpenAPI specs for each service?)
- [ ] Runbook for common operational issues
- [ ] Incident response procedures
- [ ] Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- [ ] Security architecture doc (auth flows, credential-proxy, sandbox isolation, JWT lifecycle)
- [ ] Per-service API contract docs (request/response schemas, auth requirements, error codes)
- [ ] Multi-tenancy model doc (org → team hierarchy, config merge, token scoping, RBAC)

### 9C. Code quality standards
- [ ] Review `ruff.toml` — it ignores bare excepts (E722), unused imports (F401), undefined names (F821). These should be fixed, not ignored.
- [ ] Add mypy or pyright to CI for type checking
- [ ] Add ESLint strict rules for web_ui
- [ ] Consider adding pre-commit hooks

---

## Phase 10: Testing & E2E Validation

### 10A. Local stack E2E
- [ ] Run `make dev` and verify all services start
- [ ] Create a test investigation via sre-agent API
- [ ] Verify config-service CRUD operations
- [ ] Test web_ui login and agent runner
- [ ] Test Slack integration if tokens available (`make dev-slack`)

### 10B. Write missing tests
- [ ] web_ui: at minimum, API route tests
- [ ] ultimate_rag: API and retrieval tests
- [ ] sre-agent: sandbox lifecycle tests
- [ ] Integration tests: config-service → sre-agent flow

### 10C. Load & stress testing
- [ ] Review existing `local/test_stress_e2e.py`
- [ ] Test concurrent investigations
- [ ] Test sandbox warmpool under load
- [ ] Test config-service with many teams

---

## Execution Strategy

### How to parallelize across Conductor workspaces

Each phase can be a separate workspace. Some can run in parallel:

| Wave | Phases | Can run in parallel? | Estimated effort |
|------|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Wave 0** | Phase -1 (harvest & port from deprecated) | 12+ workspaces in parallel per tool | 1-3 sessions per tool |
| **Wave 1** | Phase 0 (dead code removal) | Solo — after porting done | 1 session |
| **Wave 2** | Phase 1 (security) | Solo — highest priority | 2-3 sessions |
| **Wave 3** | Phases 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (service reviews) | All 6 in parallel | 1-2 sessions each |
| **Wave 4** | Phase 8 (infra), Phase 9 (docs) | In parallel | 1 session each |
| **Wave 5** | Phase 10 (E2E testing) | After all reviews | 1-2 sessions |

### Output per phase

Each review phase should produce:
1. **Findings doc** (`.context/findings/phase-N-findings.md`) — bugs, issues, concerns with severity ratings
2. **Fix PRs** — actual code fixes for critical/high issues found
3. **Recommendations** — medium/low issues to address later

### Severity ratings
- **P0 (Critical)**: Security vulnerability, data leak, customer-facing bug
- **P1 (High)**: Logic error, race condition, reliability issue
- **P2 (Medium)**: Code quality, maintainability, tech debt
- **P3 (Low)**: Style, documentation, minor improvements

## Key Risks Identified During Recon

These are the areas I'm most concerned about based on initial exploration:

1. **slack-bot/app.py at 8000+ lines** — high probability of bugs hiding in a monolith
2. **ultimate_rag/api/server.py with 54 classes** — AI-generated god file, likely has issues
3. **config_service/src/api/routes/internal.py with 42 classes** — same concern
4. **Zero tests for web_ui and ultimate_rag** — these are customer-facing
5. **Ruff config ignores critical linting rules** — bare excepts, undefined names, unused vars
6. **Sandbox security** — the 1700-line sandbox_manager.py controls isolation for customer clusters
7. **Multi-tenant isolation** — one config-service DB serves all customers
8. **16 Dockerfiles with inconsistent patterns** — some run as root, some don't
9. **Duplicate K8s manifests** — both in service `k8s/` dirs and Helm templates
10. **No type checking in CI** — mypy/pyright not enforced
