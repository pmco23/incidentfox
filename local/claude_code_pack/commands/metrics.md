# Metrics Analysis

I'll query and analyze metrics for: $ARGUMENTS

I can:
- Query Datadog metrics (`avg:system.cpu{*}`, etc.)
- Query CloudWatch metrics (EC2, Lambda, RDS, etc.)
- Detect anomalies using statistical analysis
- Find correlations between metrics
- Identify change points (when behavior changed)

What would you like me to analyze?
