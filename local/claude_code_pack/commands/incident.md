# Incident Investigation

I'll help you investigate this production incident using a systematic 5-phase methodology.

**Current incident**: $ARGUMENTS

Let me start by understanding the problem:

1. What are the symptoms you're seeing?
2. When did this start?
3. What's the user/business impact?
4. Were there any recent changes (deployments, config)?

Based on your description, I'll:
- Gather relevant metrics and logs
- Check infrastructure health
- Apply evidence-based investigation
- Provide actionable conclusions

I'll use the **investigate** skill methodology throughout this investigation.
