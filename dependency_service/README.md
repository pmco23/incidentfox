# Dependency Service (Premium)

**Automatic service dependency discovery from observability data.**

The Dependency Service analyzes telemetry data to build comprehensive service dependency graphs without requiring code instrumentation:

- **Distributed Tracing Analysis**: Extracts dependencies from New Relic, Datadog, and Jaeger traces
- **Log Pattern Inference**: Discovers service relationships from log correlation
- **Infrastructure Mapping**: Maps dependencies from ECS, Kubernetes, and cloud configurations
- **Real-time Updates**: Continuously updates the dependency graph as your architecture evolves

Used by the Correlation Service and Investigation Agent to understand blast radius and root cause during incidents.
