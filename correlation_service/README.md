# Correlation Service (Premium)

**AI-powered alert correlation that reduces noise by 85-95%.**

Transforms hundreds of individual alerts into actionable incidents with automatic root cause identification:

### Three-Layer Correlation

- **Temporal Correlation**: Groups alerts within sliding time windows
- **Topology Correlation**: Uses dependency graph to distinguish root cause from cascading failures
- **Semantic Correlation**: LLM-powered understanding of alert meaning ("database timeout" ≈ "connection pool exhausted")

### Root Cause Analysis

Automatically identifies:
- Root cause service (service with no failing dependencies)
- Cascading services (affected by upstream failures)
- Blast radius (number of impacted services)
- Human-readable reasoning

### LLM-Powered Summaries

Generates incident titles and summaries that help responders understand the situation immediately.
